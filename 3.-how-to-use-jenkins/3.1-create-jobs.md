**Step 4**− We need to specify the location of files which need to be built. In this example, we will assume that a local git repository\(E:\Program\) has been setup which contains a ‘HelloWorld.java’ file. Hence scroll down and click on the Git option and enter the URL of the local git repository.

**Note**− If you repository if hosted on Github, you can also enter the url of that repository here. In addition to this, you would need to click on the Add button for the credentials to add a user name and password to the github repository so that the code can be picked up from the remote repository.
